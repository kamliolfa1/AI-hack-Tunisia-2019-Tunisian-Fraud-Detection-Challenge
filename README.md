The AI Hack Tunisia 2019 is the biggest ML/AI Hackathon ever in Tunisia, Africa, and the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region. 
It takes place on 20-22 September. The event is a double hackathon: the first part is an individual Machine Learning Challenge, and the second part is a group (or as we like to say, startup) competition focused on a specific technology. With mentors, judges, and competitors from all over the world, itâ€™s going to be a blast!
